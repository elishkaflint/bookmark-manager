## Learning Outcomes

### Topics Covered

* Web applications using databases (including one-to-many and many-to-many relationships)
* RESTful routes
* The MVC model
* Test-Driven Development using Rspec and Capybara
* Object-Oriented Programming
  - classes, methods, scope, instance variables
  - ensuring code is DRY
  - using Single Responsibility Principle

###Â Personal Reflection

It's been an intense week - challenging due to the step up in project complexity but very enjoyable because we are now implementing full stack features with minimal guidance from the project instructions.

I have made good progress and feel I achieved this week's goal of learning how databases work in the context of a basic web application. I feel confident with the back end functionality we've incorporated this week but need to do more work on the 'view' and 'controller' aspects of the MVC model. I am still not 100% comfortable using forms, params and routes to achieve the correct flow through a web application and look forward to improving these skills with more practice.

## State of Completion

### Implemented Functionality

#### Front-end
* Show, add, update, delete, comment on bookmarks
* Flash error if bookmark url is invalid

#### Back-end
* Databases to hold bookmarks, comments, tags and join tables where many-to-many relationships exist
* Classes to wrap data extracted from each database
* Module for database connection in test and development environment

### Further Improvements

* Ensure all routes are RESTful
* Fix foreign keys within interrelated databases
* Add consistent styling to all webpages using CSS
* Ensure a tag cannot be created if it already exists
* Implement tag functionality in the front end
* Full test isolation between classes
* Refactoring tests (eg. using web_helper for feature tests)
